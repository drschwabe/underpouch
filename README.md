##  Under Pouch

A bunch of handy functions for filtering through documents in PouchDB. Underscore powered. 

```
var _pouch = require('under-pouch')

//native URL call to all docs
_couch.pluck(allDocs, '')
```

    
ideas:  
- Support for CouchDB (or any plain response): pass either a PouchDB object or response object (ie- the response from asking a CouchDB for allDocs)
